# Overview

DSCI 512 is a programming and algorithms course in the MDS program at UBC which introduces fundamental algorithms such as sorting and searching, as well as data structures. According to a poll done during the course, some students reported that they had been experiencing a hard time with course materials and lab assignments.This project is to analyze whether the level of programming experience prior to the MDS program affects an MDS student's self-perceived difficulty of DSCI 512 materials.

We defined null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis as following:

**Null hypothesis**: The level of programming experience prior to the MDS program does not influence a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512.

**Alternative hypothesis**: The level of programming experience prior to the MDS program influences a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512.

In this project, we will design several survey questions and collect information from other MDS students, 554 TAs and lab instructor. The process will follow the guidelines of the [UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys](https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/sites/ore.ubc.ca/files/documents/Online_Survey-GN.pdf). We will also perform regression tests to identify possible confounding variables and to further determine the significance of the level of programming experience prior to the MDS program. Last, we will discuss the results and findings of our survey.
